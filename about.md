<div style="max-width: 900px; margin: auto; line-height: 1.7; font-size: 1.05rem;">
The General Traffic Signal Specification (GTSS) provides a simple, open, and universal framework for traffic signal data, configuration and location. By defining a minimal set of four CSV files, GTSS makes it easy for cities, vendors, and developers to share, analyze, and develop signal systems reliably and consistently.

<h2 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 2rem;">Mission</h2>

To create an open, practical standard for traffic signal systems that prioritizes safety, efficiency, interoperability, and innovation, while supporting the evolution toward smart, digitization of urban infrastructure.

<h2 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 2rem;">Core Concept: Four Files, Endless Possibilities</h2>

GTSS v1.0 is intentionally simple. With just four core text files, agencies can describe every intersection in a standardized way: <br><br>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 2rem;"> 
<li><strong>agency.txt</strong> — Basic agency information: name, contact, and operational metadata.</li> 
<li><strong>signals.txt</strong> — Intersection locations, street names, and signal ID.</li> 
<li><strong>phases.txt</strong> — Each signal’s phasing, movement details and posted speed.</li> 
<li><strong>detectors.txt</strong> — Detection channels, types, and setback distance and lane assignments.</li> </ul>
<br><br>
From these four files, agencies can power performance monitoring, mapping, visualization, and analytics, while enabling developers to build new tools and services without extra configuration or proprietary barriers.

<h2 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 2rem;">History</h2>

GTSS was created to solve a fragmented traffic signal landscape, where incompatible systems and proprietary protocols caused inefficiencies and vendor bias.

<h2 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 2rem;">Get Involved</h2>

GTSS is an open specification, built with input from traffic engineers, city planners, technology companies, and safety advocates. Contributions are welcome from anyone interested in improving urban transportation systems. <br><br>
