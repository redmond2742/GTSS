# General Traffic Signal Specification (GTSS)

**A common language for traffic signal configuration.**

GTSS (General Traffic Signal Specification) is an simple, open, and standardized format for sharing and managing traffic signal configuration data. It defines core elements like signal locations, phasing, and detector information in a consistent way, making it easier to configure signals once and use them across different systems. By providing a common language, GTSS reduces vendor lock-in, supports interoperability, lowers deployment costs, and enables new tools and applications to be built on top of reliable signal data.
